This safety alert is to inform the university community about two incidents that occurred on campus this week.

At 3:42 a.m., Wednesday, January 29, a suspect followed a student into a Baker Hall computer lab through the Frew St. entrance. Known as “piggybacking,” the suspect
entered the lab by closely following the student and gaining entry before the door had time to close. The suspect then illegally accessed a computer that a previous user
was still logged into. A CMU police officer on foot patrol observed this and arrested the man.

At 1:24 p.m., Thursday, January 30, a suspect entered the third floor of The College of Fine Arts after leaving threatening phone messages with a family member who works
there, stating that he was coming to campus. The suspect came to campus and entered through a locked door that was propped open and began damaging property in an
office. CMU police arrested him.

Both of these incidents involve practices that threaten the safety of our community members and I would like to remind you to:

Log off any computer you use when finished;
Do not allow others you don’t know to “piggyback” through secure doors; and
Do not prop open doors that are to be locked for security purposes.
Respectfully,

Chief Tom Ogden
University Police

This Safety Alert is to inform the university community about an incident that occurred near the intersection of Ellsworth Avenue and Aiken Avenue on
December 14, 2019 at approximately 9:55 a.m. A CMU student reported that a beige, older model truck with a matte finish and peeling paint pulled over next to her.
The male driver then yelled, “Hey woman, get in the car!” The CMU student refused, and the driver of the truck sighed loudly, “Ugh,” then sped away traveling
westbound on Ellsworth Avenue.

The driver is described as male, approximately 60 years old, partially bald with gray hair. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is investigating the incident.

General Prevention and Safety Tips:

Stay alert to your surroundings at all times.
Stay close to friends and do not interact with strangers.
Do not approach suspicious persons or vehicles.
Report any suspicious incidents, persons or vehicles immediately to CMU Police at 412-268-2323, or off campus to the Pittsburgh Police at 911.

This safety alert is to inform the CMU community about an off-campus groping incident that occurred last night at the intersection of South Negley and Ellsworth avenues.

At approximately 11:25 p.m. Saturday, November 9, a CMU student was grabbed in the buttocks area as she was walking along South Negley Ave. The suspect is
unknown to her and is described as a male in his 20s, around 6 feet tall with a thin build and crew cut, wearing a blue sweater and jeans. He grabbed her once 
and walked away. She was not injured.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is investigating this incident with assistance from the CMUPD.

Carnegie Mellon University Police has learned that several male students have recently been lured into online schemes demanding payment to prevent the release 
of sensitive videos/photographs.

The reported incidents follow the same pattern. Male students are initially contacted via social media, such as Facebook, by a suspect purporting to be a female 
romantically interested in them. In some cases, the victims are sent explicit photos by the suspect. After a brief conversation, the victims are then asked to continue 
the conversations via Skype or Facebook Messenger. The victims then are encouraged to remove their clothes and/or perform sexual acts in view of the camera. 
Afterward, an unknown person contacts the victim, claiming to have recorded the event, and demanding money to prevent the release of the recording. Some of the 
victims were told the video would be posted on social media and/or sent to friends and family if payment was not made. These incidents are similar in nature to a series of 
scams perpetuated at a number of universities, including CMU in 2016.

We are urging you to be careful about your online activities and to be skeptical of requests to perform acts on camera. Remember, once photos or videos 
are made available to others via the internet, it may be difficult to prevent disclosure and dissemination of the content.

Anyone experiencing this type of incident, or with information related to them, is asked to contact CMU Police at 
412-268-2323 and/or the Office of Title IX Initiatives at 412-268-7125. Reports will be handled discreetly.

Sincerely,

Tom Ogden
Chief of University Police
